# Veni Vidi Vici
A collaborate project designed to bring a more inspirational approach to travel planning. This application can be for both discovery and budgeting. A MEAN stack application complete with authentication, Facebook OAuth, and a RESTful API.

##The Build
The app used JWT authentication and was built using the MEAN stack with Bourbon for responsive CSS. The app is mobile responsive but the budget planner and tracker features are best experienced on a tablet or desktop device.

My role in our team of 3 was predominantly focused on the backend authentication and database modelling. On the frontend, I was responsible for building the budgeting features of the app, including Skyscanner API integration, in-place form editing, and maintenance of the user flow should they be interrupted by the registration form.

##The Idea
We wanted to create an collaborative platform that allowed users to discover and share beautiful travel destinations, and learn how much it would really cost to get there.

With Veni Vidi Vici, users can browse through a gallery of destinations shared by other users and click through to learn more information about the location. Should users find somewhere that piques their interest, they can 'live the dream', or at least find out the cost to do so. 

An integrated budget planner accesses the lastest flight cost data via the Skyscanner API, estimates an accommodation and expenses cost based on the trip duration to provide the user with a realistic expectation of the cost of a trip. 

Users can edit and save their budget should they so wish. Saving the plan enables users to see weekly savings targets and update their curret savings to see progress to their end goal.

Users with an account are then able to share their travel discoveries with other users to keep the community and selection of destinations growing. 

Further development is planned to introduce a moderation stage whereby new locations are reviewed before publish to the site.
